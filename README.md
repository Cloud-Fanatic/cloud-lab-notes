# CloudLab - AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes & GitOps&nbsp;

## ‚òÅÔ∏è About This Project ñ£ò&nbsp;
Hi, I'm Sean G!
This repository documents my personal cloud lab, built to explore and demonstrate modern Cloud Engineering and DevOps practices using real-world production technologies.

It showcases an end-to-end, GitOps-driven CI/CD environment with automated infrastructure provisioning, secure secret management, and continuous delivery pipelines.&nbsp;

### Tech Stack Overview&nbsp;

‚û°Ô∏è Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ‚Äî Provisioned with Terraform on AWS (VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2, ECR)

‚û°Ô∏è Kubernetes (k3s) ‚Äî Lightweight production-grade cluster hosted on AWS EC2

‚û°Ô∏è GitOps Continuous Delivery ‚Äî Managed with FluxCD, syncing cluster state directly from Git

‚û°Ô∏è Continuous Integration (CI) ‚Äî Implemented via GitHub Actions for automated builds, testing, image scanning, and deployments to Amazon ECR

‚û°Ô∏è Secrets Management ‚Äî Securely handled through Sealed Secrets and optional External Secrets Operator

‚û°Ô∏è Observability Stack ‚Äî Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for metrics, dashboards, and log aggregation

‚û°Ô∏è Security & Policy Enforcement ‚Äî Enhanced with Kyverno and Trivy for compliance and vulnerability scanning<br>
